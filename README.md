The reason i made this little script can be found in [this post](http://www.ovalerio.net/content/node/45)

How to use it
=============

in the folder of the script type: 

	python ffbbe.py input.json output.adr

where 'input.json' is your firefox's bookmark file and 'output.adr' is the new file to be created.

Now you just have to open your Opera browser and import the bookmarks using the new file you have just created. 


Improvements
============

Other browsers and formats would be a nice feature to add (may be in the near future).


Licence
=======

You are free to do whatever you want with it.
